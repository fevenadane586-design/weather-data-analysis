# Weather Data Analysis 🌤️

A Python-based data analysis project that processes and visualizes weather data to identify temperature trends, calculate average temperature, and detect the hottest and coldest days.

## 📊 Features
- Reads weather data from a CSV file
- Computes the **average temperature**
- Identifies the **hottest and coldest days**
- Generates a **line plot** showing temperature trends over time

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (for data processing)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   https://github.com/fevenadane586-design/weather-data-analysis.git?spm=a2ty_o01.29997173.0.0.2d71c921t4fhIW&file=weather-data-analysis.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd weather-data-analysis

3. Install required packages:
   pip install pandas matplotlib

4. Run the analysis script:
  python analysis.py

## 💡 Sample Output

When you run the code, you’ll see output like:

Average Temperature: 22.94°C
Hottest Day: 2025-10-04 (28.3°C)
Coldest Day: 2025-10-05 (18.2°C)
And a temperature trend plot will appear!

## 🌍 Built During DevTech Internship
This project was developed as part of my internship at **DevTech**, applying data analysis and Python programming skills to real-world datasets.
